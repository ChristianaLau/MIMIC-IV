# MIMIC-IV Dataset Analysis
This analysis uses the MIMIC-IV Clinical Database to examine the relationship between medication choices, administration patterns, and patient severity at a systemic level.

We attempt to answer the following questions:
1. Whether medications are being used consistently across demographic groups
2. Whether high-severity patients recieve meaningfully different treatments
3. Whether antibiotics or high-cost drugs are being overused
4. Whether medication discontinuations or changes reveal operation inefficencies

To achieve this, we have 3 goals to be completed over the course of the project:
- Goal 1: Analyze Medication Utilization Patterns across Demographics
- Goal 2: Reconstruct simplified medication workflows
- Goal 3: Identify High Rest or High-Cost Drug Patterns

Final Deliverables:
- Tableau Dashboard Package
- Executive Summary
- Technical Notebook
